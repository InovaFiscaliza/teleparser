    This parameter contains Type of Number (TON), Numbering

    In case of mobile originating Call Component, this
    parameter contains the number received from the UE,
    excluding prefixes. Overdecadic digits received from
    a user equipment can be mapped to other values using
    Exchange Parameters.

    In case of mobile terminating Call Component, mobile
    terminated short message service in MSC/VLR, and
    mobile terminated short message service in SMS-GMSC, the
    called party number is the called MSISDN number.

    In case of call forwarding component, the parameter
    contains the number of the party to whom the call is
    forwarded.

    In case of transit Call Component and roaming call
    forwarding component, this parameter contains the
    number received from the incoming network. See also
    the clarification for transit component in case of
    IN calls in the next paragraph.

    In all IN-traffic cases, the parameter has the possible
    IN-prefix. When a call is routed to an SSF/gsmSSF because
    of terminating IN service or terminating IN category key
    service, the parameter is the possible IN-prefix and
    MSISDN in case of transit component. In case of CAMEL
    service, the prefix mechanism is not used. When a call
    is routed from the SSF/gsmSSF, the parameter may be
    modified by SCF/gsmSCF.

    If an additional MSISDN is used as the called-subscriber
    number, either the 'main' MSISDN or the additional MSISDN
    is registered in the terminating Call Component, according
    to an Exchange Parameter.

    If the subscriber uses the 'international prefix button'
    ('+'-button), then Type of Number (TON) for the
    called-party number in the mobile-originating record
    contains TON=1(international format). No prefix is
    stored in the digit information.

    If the subscriber selects the international prefix by
    himself, then TON=2 (unknown), and the prefix is included
    in the beginning of digit information.

    No Called Party Number is available when a call is
    originated using emergency call set-up. Emergency calls are
    indicated in the Teleservice Code field."""
